Hereâ€™s a sample `README.md` file for your GitHub repository to describe your **NTier Online Store API** project. You can customize the sections as needed:

```markdown
# Online Store API (NTier Architecture)

## Overview

This is a **.NET Core Web API** for an online store system developed with **NTier architecture**, using the **Repository Pattern** for data access, **DTOs** for data transfer, and **Services** for business logic. The API includes functionality for managing products, customers, and orders, and is secured with **JWT Authentication**. 

The system supports:
- **CRUD operations** for Products, Customers, and Orders.
- **JWT Authentication** for login and registration.
- **Error handling** and validation at various levels.
- **Repository pattern** to separate concerns.
  
### Key Features

- **NTier Architecture**: Separation of concerns into API, BLL (Business Logic Layer), and DAL (Data Access Layer) for scalability and maintainability.
- **JWT Authentication**: Secure access with token-based authentication for login and registration.
- **Repository Pattern**: Used for clean and maintainable data access in the DAL.
- **DTOs**: Data Transfer Objects for smooth communication between layers.
- **Error Handling**: Detailed error messages and exception handling.
- **Custom Responses**: Tailored responses for API endpoints like `GetOrderById` and `GetAllProducts`.

## Technologies Used

- **.NET Core 8.0**
- **Entity Framework Core**
- **SQL Server**
- **JWT Authentication**
- **Swagger UI** for API documentation
- **AutoMapper** for mapping DTOs

## Project Structure

The project is divided into the following layers:

- **API Layer**: Contains the controllers for handling HTTP requests.
- **BLL (Business Logic Layer)**: Contains the services and business logic for the application.
- **DAL (Data Access Layer)**: Implements the repository pattern for data access.
- **Common**: Holds shared resources like DTOs.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- **.NET 8.0 SDK** installed.
- **SQL Server** installed or available.
- **Visual Studio** or **VS Code**.

### Steps

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/OnlineStoreAPI.git
   cd OnlineStoreAPI
   ```

2. Setup database:
   - Update the connection string in `appsettings.json`:
     ```json
     "ConnectionStrings": {
       "DefaultConnection": "Server=your_server;Database=OnlineStoreDB;Trusted_Connection=True;"
     }
     ```

   - Apply the migrations to create the database:
     ```bash
     dotnet ef database update
     ```

3. Run the API:
   ```bash
   dotnet run
   ```

## How to Use

- You can interact with the API through **Swagger** at `https://localhost:5001/swagger` or through a tool like **Postman**.
- To access secured endpoints, you need to:
  - **Register** a new user via `POST /api/auth/register`.
  - **Login** to get a JWT token via `POST /api/auth/login`.
  - Use the token in the **Authorization** header to access secured endpoints (e.g., `Authorization: Bearer <your_token>`).

---

## API Endpoints

### Auth
- `POST /api/auth/register`: Register a new user.
- `POST /api/auth/login`: Login and get a JWT token.

### Products
- `GET /api/products`: Get all products.
- `GET /api/products/{id}`: Get a product by ID.
- `POST /api/products`: Create a new product.
- `PUT /api/products/{id}`: Update a product.
- `DELETE /api/products/{id}`: Delete a product.

### Customers
- `GET /api/customers`: Get all customers.
- `GET /api/customers/{id}`: Get a customer by ID.
- `POST /api/customers`: Create a new customer.
- `PUT /api/customers/{id}`: Update a customer.
- `DELETE /api/customers/{id}`: Delete a customer.

### Orders
- `GET /api/orders`: Get all orders.
- `GET /api/orders/{id}`: Get an order by ID.
- `POST /api/orders`: Create a new order.

---

## Future Enhancements

- Add **Unit Testing** for each layer.
- Implement **Caching** for performance improvements.
- Expand functionality for **Order Management**, such as filtering by status.
- Add **Role-based Access Control** (RBAC) for different user roles (e.g., admin, customer).

### Steps to Customize:
- Replace the `git clone` URL with your repository link.
- Update the **Project Structure** section with your actual folder structure if it differs.
- Update the **Technologies Used** if you're using additional packages or tools.
- Tailor the **API Endpoints** section based on your current endpoints and features.

This `README.md` provides a detailed overview of your project and should help others understand and use your API effectively.
